I am a doctoral student advised by [Dr. Shalmali Joshi](https://reaim-lab.github.io/shalmalijoshi.html) and [Dr. Pierre Elias](https://members.dbmi.columbia.edu/CRADLE/) at the [Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI)](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University. Previously, I was a researcher at the National Cancer Center-Korea and received my Master of Science in Information Systems under the advisement of Dr. Deborah Estrin at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/jacobs-technion-cornell-dual-ms-health-tech/) and Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at New York University.

My first name is "Young Sang" but I prefer to be called "Young" (like the opposite of "old").

You can reach me via email at `young[dot]sang[dot]choi[at]columbia[dot]edu`.

## Research
My research sits on the intersection of multimodal learning, event stream modeling, and trustworthy machine learning. I am particularly interested in how these fields converge to create reliable AI-based systems to advance human health. Selected works are listed below:

**ICYM<sup>2</sup>I: The Illusion of Multimodal Informativeness under Missingness**<br>

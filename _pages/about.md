I am a doctoral student advised by [Dr. Shalmali Joshi](https://reaim-lab.github.io/shalmalijoshi.html) and [Dr. Pierre Elias](https://members.dbmi.columbia.edu/CRADLE/) at the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University.

Previously, I was a researcher at the National Cancer Center-Korea and received my Master of Science in Information Systems under the advisement of Dr. Deborah Estrin at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/jacobs-technion-cornell-dual-ms-health-tech/) and Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics at New York University.

My first name is Young Sang but I go by Young (like the opposite of "old"). You can reach me via email at `young[dot]sang[dot]choi[at]columbia[dot]edu`.

## Research
My research is on machine learning for clinical informatics with a focus on multimodal learning.

In particular, I am currently exploring the following:

- When does the inclusion of more input modalities improve the performance and robustness of predictive models?
- Does domain knowledge on the relationship between modalities and learning tasks help us better model multimodal interactions?
- Can shared and synergistic information from multiple accessible modalities replace more inaccessible modalities in clinical decision support?

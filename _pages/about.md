I am a first-year PhD student in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) at Columbia University advised by [Dr. Shalmali Joshi](https://shalmalijoshi.github.io/reAIM/) and [Dr. Pierre Elias](https://members.dbmi.columbia.edu/CRADLE/). My research is on machine learning for clinical informatics, with a current focus on multimodal learning.

In particular, I am interested in exploring the following:

- When does the inclusion of more input modalities improve the performance and robustness of predictive models?
- Does domain knowledge on the relationship between modalities and learning tasks help us better model multimodal interactions?
- Can shared and synergistic information from multiple accessible modalities replace more inaccessible modalities in clinical decision support?

Previously, I was a researcher at the National Cancer Center-Korea and received my MS in Information Systems at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu/programs/masters-programs/jacobs-technion-cornell-dual-ms-health-tech/).

My first name is Young Sang but I go by Young (like the opposite of "old"). My pronouns are he/him/his.
